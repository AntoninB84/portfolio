# 💼 Personal Portfolio – Built with Next.js

Welcome to the source code of my **personal portfolio website**, built using **Next.js**.
This project serves a dual purpose:

* It showcases my background, experience, and the projects I’ve worked on.
* It is itself a **learning project**, developed to explore modern web technologies and fullstack development practices.

## 🌐 What’s inside?

The site is divided into two main parts:

* **Public section**: Includes my personal introduction, a detailed list of my projects, and a contact page.
* **Admin dashboard (CMS)**: A private back-office area that allows me to manage and update the content of the Projects page through a custom-built interface.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is fully functional, but it’s also an ongoing learning journey.
I’m aware that several areas can be improved—from code structure and scalability to performance and development workflow (testing, error handling, accessibility, etc.).

I plan to continue refining and expanding it over time as I learn and apply better practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend & SSR**: Next.js, React
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
